and discharge of municipal effluent. Municipal effluent entering the treatment system_x000D_
is restricted to what is generated by the occupants of Jedney Camp._x000D_
The treatment system consists of a two-cell lagoon and adjacent discharge area._x000D_
Effluent from Jedney Camp is collected in the first cell with an approximate volume of_x000D_
8,700m3. The first cell acts as a facultative lagoon used to promote bacterial growth_x000D_
and break down organic matter in the effluent. After primary treatment, effluent is_x000D_
pumped into the second cell with an approximate volume of 4,560m3. This cell_x000D_
functions primarily as a polishing (maturation) pond. Treated effluent, post laboratory_x000D_
analysis and a confirmation of approved parameters, is discharged off-site from the_x000D_
second cell via perforated sprinkler hoses to the adjacent area. The adjacent_x000D_
discharge area, maximum size of 4ha, is located on Crown land. The nearest facility,_x000D_
Spectra b-088-J/094-G-01 is located approximately 1 km east of the discharge area._x000D_

_x000D_
Stack emission from a wood burning appliance.  Carbonaceous material (wood) is thermochemically devolatized to separate the volatile matter into the gas stream and remove a pure source of carbon in its solid form.  The gases are then ignited with excess oxygen in a separate burner and combusted at high temperature; the resulting flue gases are then passed through a water scrubber to both cool and clean the gases prior to release into the stack._x000D_
_x000D_
Prior to discharge, emissions will be scrubbed through a contact water scrubber consisting of a vertical tube filled with inert contact material matrix (river rock) sitting on top of a water storage tank.  Water is pumped into the top of the tube and must flow around and through the river rock on its return path to the tank below. The exhaust gases enter at the bottom of the vertical tube and must pass through the matrix and water in a counter flow direction.  Entrained particulate within the exhaust gases are trapped in the down flowing water and deposited in the storage below, cleaning and cooling the gases.  The thermal energy is removed from the system though a heat exchanger and the water is recycled to the scrubber.   _x000D_

Sediment that builds up in the storage tank will build up in the storage tank and require removal (landfill) but during trials, no sediment or effluent will be removed except for the purposes of lab testing._x000D_

A certificate of compliance for the site is not being sought. Risks associated with former refinery operations are being managed in place under Ministry supervision via Protocol 12. Risk management of the Protocol 12 issues and other routine activities result in the excavation of soils that exceed IL standards which are typically stockpiled and classified according to Protocol 1. _x000D_
_x000D_
In brief, the proposed approach is to re-purpose existing tank lots for long-term management of soils that exceed IL standards. Each tank lot has a containment berm and water drainage system that carries water to a stormwater treatment lagoon with a permitted discharge. Soil will be segregrated into four categories based on its concentration and nature of contamination. Material with IL+ concentrations of readily-degradable hydrocarbons will be biopiled per Protocol 15 and treated until it meets IL standards. Material with up 3xIL concentrations of non-degradable hydrocarbons or metals will be stored in a former tank lot. Material with greater than 3xIL concentrations of non-degradable hydrocarbons or metals will be placed in an engineered storage cell. Material with highly leachable metals or liquid NAPL will be removed for off-site disposal in a third-party permitted landfill. _x000D_

Trail Operations (Teck) operates an integrated lead and zinc smelting and refining complex (Trail Metallurgical Operations, TMO) and fertilizer plant (Trail Fertilizer Operations, TFO) in Trail BC.  Cooling water, condensate, treated effluent, treated groundwater and stormwater from the TMO are combined in a sewer system that discharges effluent to the Columbia River via two combined outfalls, Combined II (CII) Outfall and Combined III (CIII) Outfall.  The discharge is permitted under the BC Environment Management Act permit 2753 (site reference discharge number E102983 and E102984)._x000D_
_x000D_
As part of Teck’s ongoing focus on continuous improvement, Teck has developed the CII Stormwater Management project to improve management of stormwater that currently flows to the CII Outfall.  The project was first discussed with the Ministry of the Environment in April 2014 at a conceptual level and was further refined through pre-feasibility and feasibility engineering in 2016.  At present the project is entering the early stages of detailed engineering._x000D_
_x000D_
Construction of the new stormwater management project will require the excavation of approximately 5,500 m3 of soil from the project site, which is in an area known to contain soils with metal concentrations greater than the Contaminated Site Regulation (CSR) Industrial Land (IL) use standards.  The excavations are required for creation of the pond and placement of valve chambers, manholes and new sewer pipelines.  The engineering design for the project incorporates the reuse of all of the excavated soil for backfill and support of the pond walls, relocation of an access road around the pond, and backfill of valve chamber, manhole and sewer pipeline areas.  _x000D_
_x000D_
For the CII Stormwater Management project, which is advancing ahead of a finalized SGMP, Teck is seeking a new approval to re-use the excavated soil at the proposed project location and manage the contaminants in-situ.  The closure plan for the soil re-use will mitigate the potential risks from soil to both human and ecological receptors using a variety of mitigation measures both project-specific and site-specific.  The project-specific mitigation measures will include the use of low-permeability liners (HDPE, geocomposite and bituminous) to mitigate the risks associated with soil ingestion, plant toxicity and migration of contaminants to underlying groundwater.  The site-specific mitigation measures will include the existing worker Health Protection Plan, Teck Drinking Water System permitted by the Interior Health Authority, Groundwater Remediation System, and Groundwater Monitoring Program._x000D_

The primary and only activity of the facility is to produce bagged and bulk Class A compost. The final products are sold to retailers and those wishing to purchase bulk compost. The materials used in the process include; yard wastes (grass clippings, bark and stem mulch), green waste, animal bedding and manures. About 23,000 tonnes of raw materials are used each year which produce around 13,000 tonnes of Class A compost. The facility has the capacity to produce more that 13,000 tonnes of finished compost per year. Market conditions and material availability are the principal driving factors for determining how much compost would be produced in a given year._x000D_
The facility has prepared Leachate and Odour Management Plans that have been attached to provide supporting information._x000D_

The work camp will be used to house 190 workers for approximately 2.5 years during construction of the Kemano Second Tunnel (T2) Project.  _x000D_
 The proposed sanitary facility will consist of a collection system and sewage treatment plant (STP). The components of the facility include a sewer collection and conveyance system (SCS), a sewage treatment plant (STP), and a drainfiled for the discharge of treated sanitary wastewater (effluent) to ground. Management of solid by-products from the STP are also included._x000D_
_x000D_
The SCS generally consists of a centralized collection system in the camp with portable restrooms to service ancillary buildings (see Site Plan). Within the camp area, the proposed SCS includes sanitary collection lines along the exterior of buildings that gravity drain to lift stations. All drainage piping is planned to be above ground for ease of access._x000D_
_x000D_
The STP consists of a packaged treatment plant designed to operate 24hours/seven days a week. The collected wastewater will be treated at the STP to meet Class A effluent standards under the Municipal Wastewater Regulation (B.C. Reg. 87/2012).  Note the design drawings and the O&M plan do not currently include a nitrogen removal system. RT and their contractor are committed to installing an STP system that is fully compliant with the MWR Class A design requriements including a nitrogen removal system. The method that will be used for the nitrogen removal remains under evaluation and has not yet been selected. Supporting documentation, including the final STP design drawings and the STP O&M Plan, will be updated to include the nitrogen removal system once this information is available and prior to effluent discharge._x000D_
_x000D_
The dewatered sludge by-product from the STP will disposed of at sludge pits authorized under Permit PRO-3127 and/or beneficially re-used as a soil amendment for restoration purposes._x000D_
_x000D_
Treated effluent will be discharge to ground via a drainfield. Sand lined trenches will a flood dosing system are proposed for the drainfield due to the coarse nature of the receiving materials. The drainfield design consists of two drainfields, two undeveloped drainfields, a sanitary alignment from the STP, and a dosing tank._x000D_

The mine will consist of two open pit gypsum quarries and will be developed using conventional top-down, open-cast mining procedures with 10 m benches. On-site extraction activities will be limited to drilling, blasting and crushing. Blended ore will be hauled to a rail load-out facility in Invermere, BC for transport to production facilities in Vancouver BC. Alternatively, crushed gypsum ore will be highway hauled to clients in Alberta or Washington State (USA). The gypsum deposit will be mined over a 43 year period; operations will produce ~ 14 Mt of waste rock that will be stored in one of four mine rock storage facilities (MRSF's), used as construction material or backfilled into two open pits. The facility includes a primary and secondary crusher with a conveyor system that moves crushed material to production stockpiles for eventual load-out and highway transport.

The plant will have the capacity to utilize residual products generated by the existing sawmill and will have a maximum annual output capacity of 90,000 tonnes of wood pellets. The operation will be built on an existing industrial site adjacent to the sawmill and all of the major equipment will be installed in an existing building. The major equipment consists of a natural gas fired belt drying system and three pellet presses. The plant will incorporate Best Available Technologies to control air emissions, fire and safety hazards and fugitive sound. This project is an enabling development for the local sawmill in that it provides a customer for its nonusable_x000D_

In April 2008 the mine ceased production and was in the care and maintenance phase of the mine life until October 30, 2015. Currently the site no longer has a permanent presence as the environmental obligations that required daily and weekly sampling have been reduced to quarterly._x000D_
_x000D_
The Underground workings are referred to as the Upper Mine (the workings above 780masl) and Lower mine (the workings below 780masl). Water infiltrates the Upper Mine workings and continuously gravity feeds to the on-site settling pond system. The lower mine workings are allowed to naturally flood to an elevation 766masl. Once the water level reaches 766masl the water is pumped to the on-site settling ponds. Barrick maintains the water elevation in the Lower Mine, at 766masl as there is a portal called the Draise, that is open to the environment at 768masl. If the water  elevation was allowed to increase to the sill of the Draise, it could discharge into Tom MacKay Creek. Pumping occurs periodically, through freshet, to ensure no discharge._x000D_
_x000D_
Barrick is working towards a final closure configuration that would eliminate the need for personnel to be on-site during freshet to maintain the lower mine water elevation below the sill of the Draise. Several studies have been complete and the most logical path forward would be to construct a spillway at the Draise and allow the water to discharge to Tom Mackay Creek throughout freshet. In the event the water level could increase to the point of discharge. To date, the modeling suggests that the the maximum elevation that the lower mine water could reach is 768masl._x000D_
_x000D_
To better understand lower mine water, and to test the modeling, Barrick is requesting an approval to not pump during freshet and allow the water from the lower mine to discharge from the Draise, in the event the water reaches that elevation. A monitoring program would be developed, to the satisfaction of the BC MoE, as well the ability to draw down the water, would be maintained._x000D_
Barrick anticipates that this real life study would be the final step toward a final closure scenario for the site.","Approximately 83 air miles north of Stewart, or 59 kilometers (km) southwest from the Bob Quinn junction on Highway 37",N/A - no operations,(999) 999-9999,not provided,56.65407,130.43362,ML450,"650 - 1021 WEST HASTINGS ST., VANCOUVER BC V6E 0C3"

The lagoon water contains some ammonia and no nitrate, which is not surprising due to the elevated BOD en low oxygen content. both nitrogen level and BOD are elevated but not nearly as high as typical contact water from agricultural sources. Chloride content may be elevated, as is the sulfur content, which may be related to the inclusion of mushroom manure (Spent Mushroom Substrate) in the topsoil. recent water analyses showed adsence of hydrocarbons in the lagoon water._x000D_

The LMY South Trench has been designed to intercept Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) in shallow groundwater within a collection trench which will direct the ARD impacted water to Teck's drainage water treatment facility and to prevent migration of impacted groundwater from the South Waste Dump into Mark Creek. Phase I of the LMY South Trench was constructed November 22, 2016 to June 14, 2017, and post construction performance monitoring indicates the LMY South Trench is functioning as designed. Phase II of the LMY South Trench will include installation of approximately 25 m of trench on Teck Owned Property (PID 011-843-659) and approximately 175 m of trench on City of Kimberley Owned Property (PID 023-122-013). Soil management for Phase II will be the same as Phase I administered under Approval 108543, where excess soil generated from Teck-owned property will remain on Teck property and  excess soil generated from City-owned property will remain on City property following construction and characterized accordingly. We anticipate approximately 8,000 m3 of soil will be disturbed during construction and a portion of the soil contains concentrations of arsenic, lead and/or zinc greater than the Contaminated Site Regulation Industrial Land Standards.   The majority of the disturbed soil will be utilized to backfill the interceptor trench.  Approximately 5% or 400 m3 of soil will be surplus after backfill, and will be managed on City of Kimberley property where it will be graded to shed precipitation outside of the trench capture limits. Following construction, a reclamation hydroseed mixture will be applied to soil disturbance areas.","100m southeast of the Lower Mine Road intersection at 115 Gerry Sorensen Way in Kimberley, BC",Michelle Unger,(250) 427-8422,Michelle.Unger@teck.com,49.6887,115.9923,"Road Dedication as per Kootenay District Plan NEP 14656, District Lots 2999, 3069","601 Knighton Road, Kimberley, BC, V1A 1C7"

To complete our investigation of the issue the City is attempting to de-water a large section of trunk storm sewer and a small section of an open storm channel. A sheet pile dam has been installed and de-watering pumps are in place; however the pumps are contacting sediment at the bottom of the channel and are not able to draw down enough water to allow for an investigation. _x000D_

To help facilitate this de-watering the City is proposing to remove sediment from the open storm channel and store it on-site. This site was previously dredged (under approval 108125) and sediment was stored on-site in 2 engineered sediment cells. These cells are still on-site and the City is proposing to make them operational again to temporarily store channel sediment to allow the de-watering to occur._x000D_

The wastewater treatment facilities associated with these registrations captured quantities of high pH sediments.  To facilitate the management of these sediments the Project will be siting a Sludge Processing Facility to produce concrete slab products from the Wastewater Treatment Plant sediments. The process involves collection of sediments and introduction of cementitious materials to bind the sediments into an inert substance. Cement process water from the Sludge Processing Facility will be limited to washout water from the mixers/tanks; this water will be transported via truck to the Horetzky Wastewater Treatment Plant.

The facility is equipped with state of the art activated sludge secondary effluent treatment using the UNOX design. This closed cell bioreactor designed by Union Carbide provides excellent treatment of the pulp and paper mill effluent and there is added capacity to treat additional volumes of effluent. The volume of sludge that the Town of Ladysmith is seeking to transfer to the mill treatment system is relatively small volume and of no concern for the very large treatment plant to process. The project will have 2 B-train highway tankers deliver to the mill each day for the duration of the project - 5 days and a total transfer of about 350 cubic meters._x000D_
_x000D_
The mill has been permitted for this activity on 3 previous occasions with 2 previous sludge transfer programs with the Town of Ladysmith. The program has functioned very well on all previous events. The tanker truck volume of slugde is delivered to the mill and discharged into the inlet of the mill primary clarifier. From the primary clarifier some solids will settle out and are then pumped directly to the sludge dewatering equipment. Some of the effluent from Ladysmith will flow through the primary clarifier and be processed within the mill secondary effluent treatment prior to discharge as treated effluent._x000D_

The HB Mine is a lead-zinc mine that was operated by Cominco Ltd. (now Teck Resources Ltd.) from 1955 to 1966 and from 1974 to 1978. The mine site is located approximately 2 km north of the TMF. The current Facility infrastructure consists of the tailings dam, tailings deposition area, tailings pond, spillway, stilling basin, access roads, instrumentation, and a small quarry. In 2012, a sloughing event occurred along the dam embankment of the tailings facility resulting in significant monitoring, maintenance, upgrades, and investigations. As a result of this, the RDCK has elected to transition the Property to ""passive closure"" (as defined by the Canadian Dam Association) with the intent to reduce liability and the resources required to maintain the facility. The overall site remediation is intended to successfully limit, counteract, prevent or mitigate the escape or migration of contamination from the facility to remove any adverse effects on the environment or human health (SRK 2018).
